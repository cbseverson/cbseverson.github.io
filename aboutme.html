	<p> My name is Courtney Severson and I'm currently learning how to be a full stack developer part time. I currently work at Kohler Company as a project analyst for supply chain/logistics. I spend my days looking through lots of data and figuring out how to use that data to implement better processes. I've always enjoyed solving problems and coding seems like a great next step. </p>
	<p> In my free time, I love to be outside. I have a dog named Chance that is a Australian Shepherd and Basset Hound mix. We spend our time at the dog park and walking along the river. I also enjoy playing tennis. </p>

	<p> Volunteering is very important to me - I've been a part of Big Brothers Big Sisters since I graduated college and I'm always looking to connect with organizations. I'm especially interested in joining a non profit board. Feel free to reach out using my contact information on my contact page! </p>
